//1. Create a program to find the bonus of 10 employees based on their years of service and the
//        total bonus amount the company Zara has to pay, along with the old and new salary.
//        Hint =>
//        a. Zara decides to give a bonus of 5% to employees whose year of service is more than 5
//        years or 2% if less than 5 years
//        b. Define a double array to save salary and years of service for each of the 10 employees
//        c. Also define a double array to save the new salary and the bonus amount as well as
//        variables to save the total bonus, total old salary, and new salary
//        d. Define a loop to take input from the user. If salary or year of service is an invalid number
//        then ask the use to enter again. Note in this case you will have to decrement the index
//        counter
//        e. Define another loop to calculate the bonus of 10 employees based on their years of
//        service. Save the bonus in the array, compute the new salary, and save in the array.
//        Also, the total bonus and total old and new salary can be calculated in the loop
//        f. Print the total bonus payout as well as the total old and new salary of all the employees
